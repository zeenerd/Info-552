            If the link doesn't work, let me summarize!
            I have my undergraduate degree in Mass Communications from Norfolk State University, with Cum Laude honors, and a focus of Film.
            Past Expereince of working at my high school (Reservior High) in MD as a library asisstant, spent a few summers working at Ram's Head as a hostess, PF Changs as a busser, and got an Internship from my college as a Fixed Assets Intern.
            For the past few years, I've worked as a Receptionist at a daycare I was raised at called Little Smiling Faces helping kids from 18 months - 5 years old, worked at Six Flags for over a year as Data Entry, Customer service at a Metal Manufacturing company, and now I work as a Night Auditor in Stevensville, MD. 
            Now, I'm working full-time as I study to get my Master's in MLIS.
