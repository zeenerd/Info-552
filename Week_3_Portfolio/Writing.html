                <p>
                    This project was based on a group of us creating a program that can teach more students about media literacy. My team deicded to create a class where students can be aids to the library so that they can learn more about the profession and provide other students with asisstance throughout the year. We need to make a prototype for the program to show hat exactly would be learned to prove that this can be suitable for a college campus.
